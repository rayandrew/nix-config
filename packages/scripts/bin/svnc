# A fast way (one line command) to run svnc commit with messages

# This script runs svn update before you try to commit.
# This way you reduce conflicts.

# Put this svnc file in your ~/bin/ ($HOME/bin) folder
# Run: chmod 700 ~/bin/svnc
#   (all script must be in executable 700 mode)
# If you use bash for your shell, open your ~/.bashrc file (or create one)
# and add this line to your ~/.bashrc
#    PATH="~/bin:$PATH"
# and then run bash again in your shell so your .bashrc is reloaded
# or just exist the current shell, and open a new one
# If you use csh as your shell, then modify your ~/.cshrc appropriately
# similar to above.

# no arg, mean this prints the instruction
